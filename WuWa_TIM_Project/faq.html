      <h2>Cross-Platform Progress Syncing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Will my progress on different servers or platforms be shared under the same Kuro Games account after the PS5™ launch?</h4>
          <p>Your progress will not be shared between different servers (e.g., Asia Server and Europe Server). However, within the same server, progress is synced across multiple platforms (PC, Android, iOS, and PS5™).</p>
          <p>If you start your journey on PS5™, you can later switch to PC or mobile platforms by logging in with the same Kuro Games account linked to your PSN account. Your progress will carry over seamlessly. Similarly, if you begin on PC or mobile, you can continue on PS5™ using the same Kuro Games account.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Which servers are available for the PS5™ version of Wuthering Waves?</h4>
          <p>The PS5™ version supports Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, America, and HMT (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) servers. However, the available server is determined by the region of your PSN account. For example: A PSN account registered in North America will access the America Server. A PSN account registered in Hong Kong will access the HMT Server.</p>

      <h2>In-game Purchase</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Can I use items purchased on PC/Android/iOS platforms (Lunites, Lunite Subscription, etc.) on PlayStation® after linking the account?</h4>
          <p>Yes, once your accounts are linked, any items purchased on one platform will be displayed and accessible on all other platforms.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h4>Why hasn't my purchase from the PlayStation™ Store/Web Store been delivered?</h4>
          <p>Items purchased through the PlayStation™Store or Web Store will be processed for delivery after you log into the game. If you're experiencing issues with delivery, please try the following methods:

           <p> Method 1: Restart the game and log in again to check if you've received a delivery notification.</p>
            
           <p> Method 2: Check your inventory through "Terminal" > "Backpack" to see if the purchased items are there.</p>
            
           <p> Method 3: Verify that the PSN account you're logged into is the same one used to make the purchase.</p>
            
            <p>If none of these methods resolve the issue, please contact customer support via "Settings" > "Feedback" in-game.</p>
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h4>If I create a new game character on PS5™, can I make purchases for this account on PC/mobile?</h4>
          <p>Yes, you can make purchases for your account on PC, mobile, or the official website.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h4>I purchased a PS5™ pre-order bundle. Which game character will receive the items?</h4>
          <p>The pre-order bundle will be delivered to the game character of the Kuro Games account linked to your PS5™ when you first log into the game.</p>
          <p>Note: To ensure the correct delivery of your pre-order bundle, please make sure the region of your PSN account matches the region of your Kuro Games account.</p>

      <h2>Account Linking</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>How do I link my PSN account to my Kuro Games account?</h4>
          <p>You can choose one of the following two methods based on your situation:</p>
          <p>Method 1: If you've previously created a Kuro Games account, it's recommended that you log in using your existing account. When you first enter Wuthering Waves on your PS5™, select "Already have an account? Log in" and follow the prompts to link your Kuro Games account with your current PSN account.</p>
          <p>Method 2: If you don't have a Kuro Games account, you can create a new one using your current PSN account. When you first enter Wuthering Waves on your PS5™, select "Create a Kuro Games account" to log into the game. (Note: If you choose this method, we recommend linking your email and setting a password in-game in "Settings" > "Account Settings" > "User Center" so that you can later access the same account on other platforms.)</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h4>How can I continue my progress from PS5™ on PC or mobile?</h4>
          <p>To carry over your game progress from PS5™ to PC or mobile, follow these steps:

            Ensure your Kuro Games account is protected by a password. You can do this in "Settings" > "Account Settings" > "User Center" on PS5™.
            
            When you open the game on PC or mobile, log in using the email linked to your PSN account and the password you set.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h4>How can I check which Kuro Games account is linked to my PSN account?</h4>
          <p>After logging into the game, you can check the linked Kuro Games account in "Settings" > "Account Settings" > "User Center."</p>
        </li>
