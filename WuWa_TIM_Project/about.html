    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Wuthering Waves is a free-to-play open world action role-playing game developed and published by Kuro Games. It was released on May 22, 2024. It is known for it's amazing graphics and beautiful landscape.</p>

    <p>Wuthering Waves is set in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world of Solaris-3 after a catastrophe called the Lament wiped out most of humanity and caused unknown beings and monsters, called Tacet Discords, to appear. Humanity adapted to the threat and over time rebuilt civilization. The story follows the amnesiac Rover, who has awakened from a deep slumber and sets out to explore this new world.</p>

    <p>It was revealed on March 23, 2022, initially inspired by Death Stranding with the aim to create a post-apocalyptic world where players can experience the fusion of new and old civilizations. The game development also draws inspiration from various sources, including Punishing: Gray Raven for its combat mechanics, as well as the Pok√©mon for its echo system. Wuthering Waves has been compared to other titles of the genre such as Genshin Impact, but aims to place greater emphasis on its combat system compared to its predecessors</p>

  <div>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Wuthering Waves is set in an open world. The player controls the protagonist Rover, as well as recruited allies called Resonators, which are split into 4-star and 5-star rarities. The endgame content features modes where characters can be used in a series of combat challenges.</p>
    
    <p>The game's combat system features Intro and Outro skills; Intro skills are triggered when the characters enters combat and Outro skills are triggered when the characters leave combat. Both abilities (skills) are triggered when the characters are switched.</p>
    
    <p>The game's gacha system features banners known as Convenes, where Resonators and Weapons can be obtained. There are three types of Convenes: novice, event, and standard. A pity system guarantees that 5-star items are obtained within a set amount of pulls.</p>

    <p>Characters may equip Echoes, granting them abilities which summon or transform characters into monsters briefly.</p>

  <h2>Terminology</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Forte:</h4>
      <p>Fortes refer to the various abilities that the Resonators wield and use during combat. There are six Fortes that all Resonators possess: Basic Attack, Resonance Skill, Resonance Liberation, Forte Circuit, Inherent Skill, Intro Skill/Outro Skill. All these Fortes can build up Concerto Energy.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Resonator:</h4>
      <p>Resonators are obtainable characters in Wuthering Waves. Individuals with the ability to resonate with certain objects and manipulate their frequencies are known as Resonators.</p>
      <p>Each Resonator has a Forte Examination Report that evaluates their status as a Resonator. These individuals exhibit a Resonance Ability, also known as a Forte through a symbol, known as the Tacet Mark, on their bodies, and they may have unique Resonance Spectrum Patterns that determine their abilities and relates to their Attributes. </p>
      <p>Exerting one's mental capacity and an exhausted emotional state can lead to Overclocking.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h4>Overclocking:</h4>
      <p>Overclocking is a state where a Resonator has lost control of their Forte as a result of overwhelming psychological stress or overexertion of their Resonance Ability. The loss of control causes the Resonator's Resonance Energy to overflow, potentially harming both the Resonator and their surroundings.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h4>Echo:</h4>
      <p>The Pangu Terminal can capture and reproduce a unique frequency, known as the Tacet Discord ability. However, there is a possibility that it will leave behind a Reverberation effect when shattered. This Reverberation can be transformed into an Echo through the Pangu Terminal's Data Bank, providing a useful advantage in combat.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Region:</h4>
      <p>Regions are parts of the map in a particular Nation. They are larger than cities and individual areas, but smaller than entire nations.</p>
      <p>Each region's part of the map is unlocked upon activation of the corresponding Resonance Nexus, which also unlocks the expedition locations for that area. Once unlocked, the map will provide information on the topography of the area, making it easier to find Resonance Beacon, Bosses and Domains.</p>
